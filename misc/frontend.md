Make sure you have node and npm installed via your package manager. 
Then, run: "npm install"

To compile, run: "npm run build"

When developing (you constantly want typescript and scss to compile), run: "npm run watch"

When deploying for production, run "npm run production", as this leads to smaller files, but is harder to debug.
